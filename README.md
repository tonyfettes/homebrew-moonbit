# A MoonBit Homebrew Tap

> [!WARNING]
> This Homebrew Tap is **UNOFFICIAL**, use at your own risk.


> [!NOTE]
> Although MoonBit is distributed via Formula in this tap, the compiler/build system toolchains are downloaded in binaries blobs. Core will be bundled in post-install stage, which happens on **your** machine. This basically means I'm downloading a binary and execute it when you install it in Homebrew. Therefore, you should have well understand the security implication before starting taping this repository and installing MoonBit.

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install tonyfettes/moonbit/<formula>`

Or `brew tap tonyfettes/moonbit` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
